//! Bidirectional bridge between a Hyper-V serial pipe (or any
//! bidirectional file-like transport) and the user's terminal.
//!
//! The pipe handle is wrapped in `pal_async::pipe::PolledPipe`, which
//! uses Windows' `FSCTL_PIPE_EVENT_SELECT` to provide non-blocking,
//! event-driven reads and writes on a single underlying handle. This
//! sidesteps the previous architecture's bug: opening one synchronous
//! pipe handle and using `try_clone()` to give the read and write
//! threads their own handles produced two handles to the **same kernel
//! File Object**, and the kernel serializes synchronous I/O at the
//! File Object level. As soon as the recv direction entered a blocking
//! `ReadFile` waiting for VM output, every subsequent `WriteFile` from
//! the send direction queued behind it. Symptom: first keystroke
//! reaches the VM, every subsequent one hangs until the pipe closes.
//! `PolledPipe` avoids the issue because all I/O on it is non-blocking
//! at the OS level and serialized only by our async runtime.
//!
//! Stdin reads still happen on a dedicated synchronous OS thread,
//! since neither std nor pal_async offer asynchronous stdin on
//! Windows. The thread forwards typed bytes to the async send task
//! over a `mesh::channel`.
